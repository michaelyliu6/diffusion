# ### Equation 1: Reverse Process
# $p$ is a **probability density function** that represents the **reverse** process, the process of adding noise. 
# 
# Let's start with the notation $p(x_T) = N(x_T; 0, I)$. $N$ is a normal distribution. $0$ is the mean (centered at zero). $I$ is the identity matrix representing the covariance (meaning that elements are independent with unit variance). It describes the distribution of completely random noise, which is the starting point $x_T$.
# 
# With that information, we can understand Equation 1. $p_\theta(X_{0:T})$ represents starting with $p(x_T)$ (a standard normal distribution) and continually multiplying other normals distibutions that have the same dimensionality. You can think of it like a blob of proabiltiies iteratively shifting around, approaching the de-noised output. 
# 
# To implement this in our code, we will be **sampling**. We will start with a sample from $p_(x_T)$ (a standard normal distribution). Next, we will pass the sample into our model to get the mean and variance terms, and use those terms with define a new Guassian to obtain a new sample $p(x_{t-1})$. We can keep repeating this process until we reach $p(x_0)$, which should look like a real $x_0$. 
# 
# ### Equation 2: Forward/Diffusion Process
# 
# $q$ is a a **probability density** function that represents the **forward** or **diffusion** process, the process of adding noise. We apply noise in small steps T, where each $\beta_t$ is a scalar that controls the variance of the normal distribution. Since we take the square root of 1 - $\beta_t$, every $\beta_t$ will less than or equal to 1. We implement the variance schedule $\beta_t$ in [Variance Schedule](##variance-schedule).
# 
# Just like the **reverse** process, the forward process is also a product of Gaussian/normal distributions. Note that every Gaussian is independent of each other. To calculate the distribution $q(x_t)$, we only need $x_{t-1}$ and the $\beta_t$ value corresponding to the step number. All pixels and color channels are noised independently. 

# ## Creating dataset
# 
# We'll first generate a dataset of random color gradients for our toy model. We will train the model to be able to recover these gradients from random images by the end of this notebook. Each of these generated images will represents our $x_0$.This should be an easy task for neural networks since the structure of the data is simple.

# Line 3 - We need to draw the number of steps of noise to add for each element of the batch, so the $t$ will have shape $(batch,)$ and be an integer tensor. Both 1 and T are inclusive. Each elemenet gets a different numer of steps of noise added.
# 
# Line 4 - $\epsilon$ is a sample noise, not sclaed by anything. It's going to add to the image, so its shape should also be $(batch, channel, height, width)$.
# 
# Line 5 - $\epsilon_\theta$ is our neural network. It takes in two arguments: the image with the noise applied in one step of $(batch, channel ,height, width)$, and the number of steps $(batch,)$, normalized to the range $[0,1]$
# 
# Line 6 - It is not specified how we know if the network is convered so we are just going to keep going until the loss seems to stop decreasing.

# In the paper, the author describes two loss functions: the variation lower bound (Equation 3) or the mean squared error (Equation 14). In our implementation, we will be using the mean squared error (MSE) since it is easier to implement, more stable during training, requires fewer compute resources, and we have only training a simple network.

# ## Sampling
# 
# <img src="references/sampling.png" alt="Sampling">
# <figcaption><code>Algorithm 2</code> in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239#page=4">Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</a></figcaption>

# Line 1 - Start with a sample from a standard Gaussian
# 
# Line 2 - Iteratively step backwards towards the original image with no noise
# 
# Line 3 - Calculate the denoised image 
# 
# Line 6 - Return the denoised final image
# 
# 
# Ror the early steps (high t), we make big changes since the image is very noisy. At later steps (low t), we make smaller, more precise adjustments as we get closer to the final image. 
# 
# Note that in Line 3 we are adding a small amount of noise (scaled by $\beta_t$) to maintains the Markov chain properties. However, the release of [DDIM (Denoiseing Diffusion Implicit Models)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02502) showed that you could remove random noise term during sampling entirely, making the process determinisitc. This led to faster sampling while maintaining good quality. Most interestingly, because DDIM is deterministic, you can smoothly interpolate between two images in the latent space. The intermediate images maintain semantic meaning (e.g., interpolating between a cat and dog image will show meaningful blends of features)
